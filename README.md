Android app to search dishes and measure their calories


You can search food using the Android Action Bar SearchWidget, It will search from
the key words you add all foods and dishes and their respective calories.

You can Favorite all those dishes you want to save locally in your phone.
You just have to select the star in each dish you want to record. These favorite
dishes will be seen even if there is no network connection.

You can store/delete dishes in batch, just long-click the first item,
then keep long-clicking in each item you want to add to list, and finally
select save or delete icon.

Soon I will be adding a detailed view for each dish/food.
